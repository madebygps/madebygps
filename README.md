I'm Gwyneth Pena-Siguenza, but most call me Gwen or GPS. I'm a [Cloud Advocate at Microsoft](https://aka.ms/madebygps), focused on helping others build on Azure. In my spare time I build open-source courseware and tools at [Learn to Cloud](https://github.com/learntocloud), document learnings and career on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/madebygps), [read](https://www.madebygps.com/books-for-technologists/), and spend time with family, friends, and cats.
